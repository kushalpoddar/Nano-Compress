# Building and requirements
Nano-Compress is created via Qt framework so it needs QtCreator (or at least `qmake`) installed to be built:
* Download Qt from: https://www.qt.io/ide

# Weird code?
Yep, a little bit. That's because this app is just a GUI adaptation of the CLI version [libcoders](https://github.com/snovvcrash/libcoders "libcoders") library.

# Platform
Nano-Compress Application was developed for Windows.
